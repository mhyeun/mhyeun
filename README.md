### Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Hi, I'm Matt.

I'm a third-year Mechatronics Engineering student at the University of Waterloo aspiring to become a full-stack software engineer. I'm most comfortable with a Javascript/Typescript stack â€” React, Node/Express, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB. I also have some familiarity working with Django and Flask.

Make sure to also visit my [site](https://mhyeun.github.io) where I recently started writing about random stuff.
