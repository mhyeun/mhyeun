### Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Hi, I'm Matt.

I'm a third-year Mechatronics Engineering student at the University of Waterloo aspiring to become a full-stack software engineer. I'm most comfortable with a Javascript/Typescript stack â€” React, Node/Express, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB.

I've recently learned some Django and Flask, too.

I finished and deployed a "for-fun" Django application where users can "emojify" tweets from anyone with a valid Twitter @. This app uses a lightweight Flask API that I developed and deployed with documentation on the [repo](https://github.com/mhyeun/twitter-emojify-api). You can check out the site [here](https://www.emoji-bot.com) and try it yourself!

Make sure to also visit my [site](https://mhyeun.github.io) where I recently started writing about random stuff.
