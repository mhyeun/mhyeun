### Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Hi, I'm Matt.

I'm a third-year Mechatronics Engineering student minoring in Software Engineering at the University of Waterloo. I'm currently interning at HomeX Labs as a software engineer!

Make sure to also visit my [site](https://mhyeun.github.io), where I sometimes write about random things.
