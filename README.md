### Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Hi, I'm Matt.

I'm a third-year Mechatronics Engineering student minoring in Software Engineering at the University of Waterloo, hoping to become a full-stack software engineer. I previously interned @ Ford Motor Company, Tjene Corp, and Thumbtack. I'm currently interning at HomeX Labs as a software engineer!
